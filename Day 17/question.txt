You are given an array of integers nums where each integer appears twice except for one element that appears only once.
Find and return the element that appears only once.
You must implement a solution with linear runtime complexity (O(n)) and use constant extra space (O(1)).

Input: nums = [2, 2, 1]
Output: 1


Input: nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
Output: 4

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
