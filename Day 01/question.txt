Problem Statement: Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an unsorted array of integers, return the length of the longest sequence of consecutive numbers.

A consecutive sequence means the numbers appear in any order but form a sequence like 1, 2, 3, 4.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time complexity.

Constraints
0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
The input list may contain duplicate numbers, but they should be ignored in counting sequences.
