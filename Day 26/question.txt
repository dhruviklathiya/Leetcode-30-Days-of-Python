Title: Top K Frequent Elements

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements.
You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵

k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in nums]

It is guaranteed that the answer is unique
