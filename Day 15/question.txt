You are given an array of integers nums. Your task is to find the majority element that appears more than n / 2 times, where n is the length of the array.
You must solve this problem in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

Input: nums = [3, 2, 3]
Output: 3

Input: nums = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Output: 2

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
