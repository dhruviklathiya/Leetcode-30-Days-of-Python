You are given a sorted array of integers nums and a target value target. Your task is to find the index where target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
If target is already present, return its index.
You must solve this problem in O(log n) time complexity

Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 5
Output: 2

Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 2
Output: 1

Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 7
Output: 4

Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 0
Output: 0
