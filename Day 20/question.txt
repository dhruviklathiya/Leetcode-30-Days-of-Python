Move Zeroes

Given an integer array nums, write a function that moves all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Examples:
Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

Input: nums = [0, 0, 1]
Output: [1, 0, 0]

Constraints:
Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
Try to minimize the total number of operations.
