Valid Parentheses

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

A string is valid if:

1. Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
3. Every closing bracket has a corresponding opening bracket of the same type.

Examples:
Input: s = "()"
Output: True

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: True

Input: s = "(]"
Output: False

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10⁴
s consists of parentheses only: '()[]{}'
