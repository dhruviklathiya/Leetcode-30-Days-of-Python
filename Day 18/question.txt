You are given a sorted array nums of n integers and a target value target.
Return the index where target is found.
If target is not found, return the index where it should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) time complexity.

Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 5
Output: 2

Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 2
Output: 1

Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 7
Output: 4

Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 0
Output: 0
