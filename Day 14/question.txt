You are given an array of integers nums. Your task is to find the longest consecutive sequence of numbers in nums in O(n) time complexity.

Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].

Input: nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]
Output: 9

Input: nums = []
Output: 0
