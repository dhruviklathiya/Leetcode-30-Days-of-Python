Title: Find All Anagrams in a String

Given two strings s and p, return all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.
You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0, 6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

Example 2:
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0, 1, 2]

Constraints:
1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10⁴

s and p consist of lowercase English letters.
